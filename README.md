LA Crime Predictor API
This project uses a linear regression model to predict violent crime rates in Los Angeles based on select socioeconomic and crime-related indicators. Built with FastAPI and deployed on Render, the API allows users to POST custom inputs (like robbery rate, assault rate, etc.) and receive real-time crime rate predictions.
